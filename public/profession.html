  <p>I play a weird instrument. It <b>ISN'T</b> a violin, but it looks very similar! The differences between the viola and violin are:</p>
  <ol class="normal-text">
    <li>The viola is bigger.</li>
    <li>The violin's strings, from lowest to highest, are G, D, A, and <u><b>E</b></u>. The viola's strings are <u><b>C</b></u>, G, D, and A. So, the range is the same size but a little bit lower in pitch.</li>
    <li>Violists read a different clef in their music. It's called the <i>alto</i> clef.</li>
  </ol>
